# ETL_Brewery_DB

This ETL process is designed to extract data from the [Brewery DB API] using NodeJS and postgreSQL. 

Do not forget to add your API key and dbconfig. You should run the **etl_menus.js** script before the **etl_beers.js** one. 

Future updates coming: adding an update scraping script to add geolocalisation information on breweries, possibly a complete ETL process, a bit of data analysis ...

Happy beer scraping !
